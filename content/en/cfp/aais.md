**Scope**

The Ocean make up over 70% of the earth's surface and it is the cradle of life on Earth, providing good and services essential for mankind.
Today many global challenges are threatening marine environment and ecosystems, putting some of those good and services at risk.
Global programs for environmental monitoring and sustainable exploitation of marine resources are based on extensive data collection and modelling made possible by technological advances.
Furthermore, in recent years, we are seeing rapid advances in the fields of artificial intelligence, computational intelligence and machine learning.
These technologies can enable tackling many of the complex challenges in marine and Earth system science, as well as contribute to sustainable ocean resource management.

The purpose of the workshop is to host recent research advances in the field of technology and applications of Computational Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Mining in the fields of marine science and engineering.
 
Potential topics include (but are not limited to):

* Theory and Methodologies
** Applied and Computational Mathematics;
** Computational Intelligence;
** Data Mining;
** Machine Learning;
** Statistical Methods.

* Applications  
** Marine Biology and Genomics;
** Marine ecology; 
** Marine applications of federating learning;
** Management of living resources;
** Satellite Imaging and Remote sensing;
** Navigation and survey planning; 
** Marine automation and robotics; 
** Signal processing and Computer Vision for Marine Science; 
** Computational intelligence at the edge and osmotic computing;
** Big data management, services and decision support tools; 
** Lagrangian/Eulerian computational modelling;
** Operational weather and marine forecasts and predictions;
** Massive workflows for AI powered marine science.
** IoT for marine science.

The scientific program will include, besides some invited talks and tutorials, contributed papers that will be presented in plenary oral or poster sessions.
