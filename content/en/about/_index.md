Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications are becoming increasingly popular in both the academic and industrial world.

In this regard, it is sufficient to mention that the turnover produced by AI has a growth rate currently estimated at 50% per year.

Within the Department of Science and Technology of the University of Naples "Parthenope" (DiST, http://dist.uniparthenope.it), it consists of a community of teachers and researchers with at least ten years of experience in the various fields of 'AI that is expressed:

in the presence, unique in Italy with the University of Bologna, of a master's degree course dedicated to these issues (Machine Learning and Big Data);

in the establishment of a Parthenope node of CINI (Interuniversity Consortium for Informatics, https://www.consorzio-cini.it) Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems (AIIS) Laboratory, which brings together the largest scientific community of researchers active in the field of AI in Italy.

Within the DIST, there are historical and consolidated research and teaching activities that have the sea as a key topic.

In fact, at the DIST there are active research groups on oceanography, meteorology and climatology, navigation and remote sensing, maritime technologies, marine biology and ecology, geology and marine geomorphology, all fields that constitute potential domain of important AI applications, both in the field academic research and in the industrial and service fields.

By implementing some operational guidelines aimed at improving the quality of the Department's scientific production, in order to favor, promote and create the conditions so that the various research groups of DIST can interact in a concerted manner, Neptun-IA was created.

Neptun-IA is an interdisciplinary laboratory that is configured as a cluster of laboratories to which the laboratories active in the scientific sectors previously declined and the laboratories with specific skills in AI, and related enabling technologies (High Performance and Cloud Computing, Internet-Of-Things) belong , Big Data).

Neptun-IA fully enhances the current skills present in the DIST, both in the marine and in the AI ​​area.

**NEPTUN-IA is unique in the national scientific landscape, serving as a leading research laboratory in the applications of AI to issues related to the sea, both at a regional and national level.**

The designated manager of Neptun-IA is Prof. Giulio Giunta, assisted by a scientific commission made up of the heads of the individual laboratories.
